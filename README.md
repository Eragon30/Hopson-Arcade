# Hopson Aracde

This is a collection of small aracde-y games, created using C++17 and SFML

## Dependancies

SFML 2.4.2 and C++17 supporting compiler

### Installing dependancies

#### Ubuntu

`sudo apt install libsfml-dev`

#### Windows

Download SFML from the website. https://www.sfml-dev.org/download/sfml/2.5.1/

## Building

### Build for Linux

Run the build and the run script

```sh
sh build.sh release
sh run.sh release
```

Ommiting the "release" will instead run the code using debug mode.

### Build for Windows

Highly dependant on your set up. If SFML is in your path, then using CMake you will be able to create the correct project files to build your code.
